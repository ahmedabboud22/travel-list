# travel-list
It's a simple React app I created for training.
Through it, you can create a list of things that you want to take with you on your trip, where you can:
  1- Adding new items
  2- Delete existing items
  3- Mark completed items
  4- Delete all items in the list with one click
  5- Arrange the items in the list through three options:
    A- Using the default entry you made
    B- Using the name
    C- Using the completed elements
There are also statistics related to the items.
The app is responsive to all displays, and is beautifully formatted.
